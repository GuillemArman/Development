# Santa
We are two students from UPC CITM Barcelona developing a 2D platformer game in C++, using SDL and XML libraries, aswell as Tiled for the maps.

## Installation
Decompress the .zip file in any directory and execute the executable inside the decompressed folder.


## Controls:

#### A: Move left
#### D: Move right
#### SPACEBAR: Jump(you can double jump)
#### W/S(ONLY WHILE GODMODE): You can move up && down in the air

## Debug Keys:

#### F1: Start from the very first level
#### F2: Start from the second level
#### F3: Start from the beginning of the current level
#### F5: Save state
#### F6: Load previous saved state
#### F8: Debug UI
#### F9: See colliders and pathfinding
#### F10: Godmode
#### F11: Enable/Disable FPS cap to 30
#### ยบ: Console

## Innovation:
Assignment 3:

- Pause Mode.
- Sliders for Volume and Fx + option to Windowed or Fullscreen.
- Measurable: You can see the final score after completing the game.

Previous Assignments:

- Simple entity system for player, thought to hold more entity types.

- Logic for entities(animations, speed, jump force and collider size and position) is defined in tiled.

	Their position on the map is also defined in tiled.

- When an enemy does not found a path to the player, after 1.5 seconds it will start flying/walking around.

## Bugs:

At the end of level 1 you might need to jump to detect the collider to get to level 2. 

Sometimes animations don't loop corectly so with cap frames activated look weird. (Press F11 to have a better experience)
