# Santa
We are two students from UPC CITM Barcelona developing a 2D platformer game in C++, using SDL and XML libraries, aswell as Tiled for the maps.


## Controls:

#### A: Move left
#### D: Move right
#### SPACEBAR: Jump(you can double jump)
#### W/S(ONLY WHILE GODMODE): You can move up && down in the air

## Debug Keys:

#### F1: Start from the very first level
#### F2: Start from the beggining of current level
#### F3: Death animation(for future purposes)
#### F5: Save state
#### F6: Load previous saved state
#### F7: Change between levels
#### F9: See colliders
#### F10: Godmode

## Innovation:

We have added the F7 debug key functionality to change between levels. 
We also are loading the player animations from  an XML file.
Logic for entities(speed, jump force and collider size and position) is defined in tiled.

Their position on the map is also defined in tiled.
